        <h2>Water Ecology</h2>
          <p>In my freshman year, and continuing, I had joined the water ecology club/class. It usually takes place on a friday 
            once a month. In this class we go out to many different sites and test out the water quality, most of the time I 
            am testing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and going to collect the water samples.</p>

          <h2>Student Council Secretary</h2>
          <p> In my Sophmore year of high school I had joined the MHS Student Council to help plan and organize events, I had 
            applied for the secretariel position and got it. I have helped plan two dances, two spirit weeks, a field day/ riot 
            day (tons of games where the each grade competes against each other.)</p>
